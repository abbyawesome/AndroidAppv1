# AndroidAppv1
Hello world!

This app is meant to act in coordination with a Raspberry Pi running the short Python code. 

This is based heavily on BlueDot (https://bluedot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I made this for an IEEE CASS student competition, and updates will be coming throughout the rest of the semester.

Have a great day!
